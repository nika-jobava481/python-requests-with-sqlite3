# JokeAPI Table Creator

This Python script allows you to create a table called "jokes" and fetch jokes from the JokeAPI (https://jokeapi.dev/). The jokes are then inserted into the "jokes" table for further use.

## Installation and Usage

To use this script, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

- pip install requests
- pip install win10toast

## how it works?


The script will create the "jokes" table if it does not already exist and fetch a joke from the JokeAPI. It will then insert the joke into the table.

- You can customize the script further to fetch and insert more jokes or modify the table structure as per your requirements.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.
